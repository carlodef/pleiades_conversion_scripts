# On boucantrin, an execution of the script create_dzi_from_tiff.sh takes less
# than 1 minute for an image of size 40000x17000, if the files are local. As
# soon as the files are on a remote disk, mounted with sshfs, the running time
# becomes huge (still not finished after one hour...). This is due to writing
# many very small files through ssh.

# As a workaround, the input files are copied locally to be processed, then the
# output files are copied back to the remote disk with a tarpipe.
