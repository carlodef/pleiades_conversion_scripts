# On boucantrin, an execution of the script create_dzi_from_tiff.sh takes less
# than 1 minute for an image of size 40000x17000, if the files are local. As
# soon as the files are on a remote disk, mounted with sshfs, the running time
# becomes huge (still not finished after one hour...). This is due to writing
# many very small files through ssh.

# As a workaround, the input files are copied locally to be processed, then the
# output files are copied back to the remote disk with a tarpipe.

# list the PlÃ©iades panchro images we have
# cd $HOME
# find nas/pleiades/satellite_images/pleiades -name "*_P_*.JP2.TIF" | grep -v "napier.broken" > list_pleiades_panchro_images_on_the_nas.txt

# For each image, copy it locally, create the dzi image then copy the dzi image
# to the nas with a tarpipe
